# ITCSS Boilerplate
An empty SASS boilerplate based on the ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) methodology for starting new projects.

Taking learning from the [CSS Wizard](https://twitter.com/csswizardry) himself (Harry Roberts), we've found ourselves using his methodology for a number of projects over the last few months. You can learn more about it by watching [Harry's talk at Dafed #27](http://csswz.it/1w9Ah55, "Managing CSS Projects with ITCSS")

As we regularly end up creating the same folder structures and SCSS files at the beginning of our new projects, we created this repository as a quick way of rolling it out. It doesn't contain any actual SASS code, just the necessary folders, files and import statements.

Feel free to use / adapt as you see fit. If you find a way to improve it, by all means make a pull request.
